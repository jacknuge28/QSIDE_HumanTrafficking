# QSIDE - Human Trafficking

### CMSE 495 Spring '23 Capstone Project<br>
Michigan State University's Data Science Capstone course is intended to provide students with an opportunity to put together what they have learned across multiple courses to develop a final project that demonstrates their ability to work in a team on real-world problems.

The capstone course has three major goals:

1. Provide students with a high impact, end-to-end project experience where they can apply classroom experiences and data science skills to solve real-world problems.
2. Provide students with opportunities to learn and practice professional skills (communication, teamwork and leadership) in the context of team-based projects.
3. Provide opportunities for students and faculty in the department to build relationships and network with industry partners, community organizations, and campus colleagues.



For other inquiries about this course, contact Dr. Dirk Colbry (colbrydi@msu.edu).
